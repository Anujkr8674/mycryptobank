to trade is the difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is fully executed. Cost to trade can result from two events: A change in the bid/ask spread in between the time a trade is placed and the trade is filled
or insufficient order book depth to support large market orders. Simulating cost to trade before executing a trade is important in cryptocurrency markets and should be incorporated into strategy backtesting. Cost to trade is measured in quote asset of
the contract.","vip-liquidity-instructionsBody10":"Market depth is the cumulative sum of all bids and asks on an order book snapshot at different intervals from the mid price. Aggregated market depth is derived directly from raw order book snapshots.
The deeper an order book, the larger the quantity of bids and asks on either side of the mid price. Generally, deeper order books indicate that a market is more liquid and can support bigger market orders. Binance currently provides aggregated depth for
both the bid side and the ask side at the following ranges from the mid price: 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%, 5%. For USDⓈ-M futures contracts, depth data is available in base asset quantity or notional amount. For COIN-M futures contracts, depth data is available in

terms of contracts’ quantity. The Cost To Trade is not calculated if there is an insufficient number of orders in the Order Book.","vip-liquidity-instructionsBody6":"A bid-ask spread is the amount by which the ask price exceeds the bid price. The Bid-Ask

<paragraph>Trend trading is an approach that leverages an asset's current price momentum in a specific direction, also known as a trend.</paragraph>
<paragraph>When the price goes up (uptrend), it is likely that it will keep moving in the same direction for some time. In an uptrend, trend traders enter a long position and hold their crypto, expecting to sell at a higher point of the trend. The reverse is true
    when an asset is in a downtrend.</paragraph>","vip-type":"Type","vip-unlock-to-visit":"Unlock VIP Access","vip-updateTip":"Daily update at UTC 02:30","vip-updated":"Updated","vip-upgraded-umf":"Upgraded USDⓢ-M Futures Maker Tier","vip-upgraded-vip":"Upgraded
