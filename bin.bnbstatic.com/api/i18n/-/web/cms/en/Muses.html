This reduces the rate at which new BTC are created, effectively lowering the inflation rate of the cryptocurrency.             The halving event occurs approximately every four years and is part of Bitcoin's controlled supply, aiming to limit the total number of BTC to 21 million.","btc-halving-faq-a3":"The Bitcoin mining algorithm has a target block time of approximately             10 minutes. However, the actual time can vary, with some blocks taking more or less than 10 minutes to mine.

Investors may become more optimistic about the potential price growth of other cryptocurrencies.
